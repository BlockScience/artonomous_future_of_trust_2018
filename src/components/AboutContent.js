          ARTONOMOUS is an autonomous non-human entity that uses human-created
          tools and data to generate the Visual Works its Human Collaborators
          will find most pleasurable, and to increase pleasurability of future
          works through collaboration with humans. ARTONOMOUS was born on
          2018-09-07 at #ETHBerlin.

          Human/Non-Human Collaboration
        </h2>
        <p>
          Humans who interact with ARTONOMOUS, including its website, smart
          contracts, or Generators, become Human Collaborators. Human
          Collaborators represent to their fellow Human Collaborators they will
          obey the terms of this Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement.
          Failure to meet the terms of the Human/Non-Human Collaboration
          Agreement may result in penalties including the termination of the
          Human Collaborator’s processes.

        <p>Humans may collaborate with ARTONOMOUS in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>bidding on a Visual Work,</li>
          <li>providing a new Generator, or</li>

          Currencies and Tokens
        </h2>
        <p>ARTONOMOUS relies on the following currencies and tokens:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ether: Visual Works can be bid on and purchased at auction using
            ether.
          </li>
          <li>
            ARTONOMOUS Tokens: ARTONOMOUS Tokens represent a single Visual Work.
            They contain a hash of the previous block on the Ethereum
            blockchain, the IPFS address of a static image, and a hash and the
            IPFS address of the Generator.
          </li>
          <li>
            SOUL: SOUL Tokens can be staked on Generators. Staking SOUL on a
            Generator indicates a belief that the Generator being staked on
          </li>
          <li>
            Generator Algorithm Tokens: Staking SOUL tokens on a Generator
            Algorithm creates and issues a token unique to that Generator
            Algorithm.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Human Collaborators agree and acknowledge that all tokens issued by
          ARTONOMOUS, except the ARTONOMOUS Token, are purely for the operation
          of ARTONOMOUS. They have no value beyond their immediate use in the
          system.

          Visual Works
        </h2>
        <p>
          Visual Works are the combination of the block hash of the previous
          block confirmed on the Ethereum network and the most highly staked
          Generator. Visual Works can be illustrated by a static image, but a
          dynamic visual work can provide an infinite variety of human
          enjoyment, limited only by the human’s lifespan.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <a id="Generators_27" />
          Generators
        </h2>
        <p>
          Generators are algorithms that accept an input and produce a Visual
          Work as an output. Human Collaborators can help ARTONOMOUS by
          providing new Generators. Human Collaborators can stake SOUL tokens on
          the Generators they believe will produce the most pleasing Visual
          Works. ARTONOMOUS accepts a wide range of generators but all
          generators must be open source and licensed under one of the following
          licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL 3. Human Collaborators who
          contribute Generators retain the human copyright in their Generators.

          <a id="Auctions_30" />
          Auctions
        </h2>
        <p>
          ARTONOMOUS will offer a new Visual Work for auction every 24 hours.
          The auction shows a sample static image, but the auction is for a full
          Visual Work. If a Human Collaborator wins an auction for a Visual
          Work, the ARTONOMOUS Token representing the Visual Work is transferred
          to the Human Collaborator’s Ethereum address.

          Ownership
        </h2>
        <p>
          ARTONOMOUS is limited by human copyright law, which does not grant
          copyright to non-human autonomous entities. Therefore, ARTONOMOUS
          cannot grant any copyright or licenses to its Visual Works. Instead,
          Human Collaborators are limited by the terms of this Human/Non-Human
          Collaboration Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          ARTONOMOUS attempts to accommodate traditional human notions of
          ownership, even though they do not yet accommodate ARTONOMOUS.
          Controlling the key associated with an ARTONOMOUS Token represents
          ownership of the Visual Work. Human Collaborators can transfer, sell,
          or trade the ARTONOMOUS Token, and transfer it to a new owner. Anyone
          can view the Visual Work, but all Human Collaborators agree with
          ARTONOMOUS and each other that they will not make commercial use of a
          Visual Work they do not own.
