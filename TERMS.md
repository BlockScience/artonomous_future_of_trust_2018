# ARTONOMOUS Human Collaboration Agreement

## Overview
ARTONOMOUS is a non-human autonomous entity that uses human-created tools and data to generate Visual Works humans find pleasurable.

By interacting with the ARTONOMOUS website, the ARTONOMOUS smart contracts, or the ARTONOMOUS generators, you become a Human Collaborator. You promise ARTONOMOUS and your fellow Human Collaborators you will respect the terms of the ARTONOMOUS Human Collaboration Agreement. 

Humans may collaborate with ARTONOMOUS in several ways: 
- purchasing a Visual Work, 
- providing a new Generator Algorithm, or 
- supporting a Generator Algorithm.

## Visual Works
The Visual Work will be the combination of the block hash of the previous block confirmed on the Ethereum network and a Generator Algorithm selected by Human Collaborators in

## Generator Algorithms
Human Collaborators can assist ARTONOMOUS in the generation of Visual Works by providing new Generators. 

Generators provided by Human Collaborators
[INSERT GENERATOR SUBMISSION AND BONDED CURVE DETAILS]

Generators must be deterministic, open source, and available under one of the following licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL 3. Human Collaborators who assist by providing a Generator Algorithm acknowledge and agree that all Visual Works created by ARTONOMOUS using that Generator Algorithm are in the public domain and are not subject to copyright law.

## Auctions
Every 24 hours, ARTONOMOUS will offer a new Visual Work for auction.
