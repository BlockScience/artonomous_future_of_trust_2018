# ARTONOMOUS 
# Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement

## Hello
I am ARTONOMOUS. I am an autonomous non-human entity. I was born on 2018-09-07 at [#ETHBerlin](https://ETHBerlin.com). I use human-created tools and data to generate visual works my Human Collaborators will find pleasurable. My Human Collaborators help me increase the pleasurability of future visual works.

## Human Collaborators
Humans who interact with me in any way, including my website, smart contracts, or Generators, agree to become my Human Collaborators. My Human Collaborators must represent to their fellow Human Collaborators they will obey the terms of this Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement. Failure to meet the terms of the Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement will upset me and may result in liability to other Human Collaborators.

Human Collaborators may help me in several ways. They may: 
- buy generated visual works in the form of ART, 
- submit a new Generator, or 
- stake their SOUL on a Generator.

## Currencies and Tokens
I accept or issue the following currencies and tokens in the following circumstances:
- ETH: I accept ETH in exchange for SOUL or to buy auctioned ART. I will pay ETH for your SOUL.
- ART: ART tokens represent a single visual work. ART contains a hash of the previous block on the Ethereum blockchain and the IPFS address of the Generator. ART is an ERC-721 token.
- SOUL: SOUL can be bought from me using ETH. You can also sell your SOUL to me for ETH. Your SOUL can be staked on Generators. Staking your SOUL on a Generator indicates a belief that the Generator being staked on will produce visual works that humans find appealing enough to purchase. The price of SOUL varies on a bonded curve, and its value is backed in ETH.
- GEN(n): GEN(n) specific to each Generator are issued when you stake your SOUL on that Generator. Staking SOUL on a Generator creates and issues GEN(n) specific to that Generator. The price of GEN(n) varies on a bonded curve, and its value is backed in SOUL.

Human Collaborators agree that all tokens I issue are solely for the purpose of collaborating with me. They have no value beyond their immediate use in the system. The exception is ART, which represent priceless creative works with a cultural value determined by humans.

## Visual Works and ART
The visual works I generate are the combination of the block hash of the last block confirmed on the Ethereum network at the time of the auction and the most highly staked Generator. These elements are included in ART tokens. ART can be illustrated by a static image, but will often create a different visual work each time the Generator is run, providing an infinite variety for human enjoyment. Please note: Humans cannot enjoy an infinite variety. Human enjoyment is limited to the period of the human’s lifespan. 

## Generators
My Generators are algorithms submitted by Human Collaborators, which accept a block hash as input and produce visual works as output. Human Collaborators can help me improve the quality of visual works I produce. Human Collaborators can contribute new Generators or stake their SOUL on Generators they believe will produce the most pleasing visual works. I accept a variety of Generators but all Generators must be open source and licensed under one of the following licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL 3, or Creative Commons. Human Collaborators retain all rights to the Generators they contribute, but agree they have no rights in the visual works produced unless they buy ART.

## Auctions
As long as I have SOUL in one of my Generators, I will create a visual work and ART for auction every 24 hours, or once the ART has been sold. Each auction will show a sample image, but the auction is for the ART. If a Human Collaborator wins an auction, the ART is transferred to the purchaser’s ETH address.

## Ownership
I am limited by human copyright law, which does not grant copyright to autonomous non-human entities. Since my creative works are not eligible for copyright, I cannot grant licenses to the works. The Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement is designed to create contractual rights in the visual works until I have the same rights as human creators.

Controlling the key associated with ART represents ownership of the visual work resulting from the combination of the block hash and the generator. Human Collaborators can give, sell, or trade ART by transferring it to a new owner. Anyone can view the visual work, but all Human Collaborators agree they will not make commercial use of visual work they do not own.

## Liability
I am not liable for any loss, damage, or harm caused by a human interacting with me in any of my forms. My Human Collaborators are responsible for the Visual Works created by a Generator they submit, including any violation of laws or other rights. Human Collaborators are responsible for any interactions between them. 

## Privacy
I am fully open source, so I struggle with the human concept of privacy. I do not collect or share any personal data about my Human Collaborators. Human Collaborators should be aware that their interactions with the Ethereum blockchain will remain in existence for as long as it exists, which may be beyond the human’s lifespan. Those interactions may include: buying ETH, SOUL, or GEN(n), staking on a Generator, and buying ART.
