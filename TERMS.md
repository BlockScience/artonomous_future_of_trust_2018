# ARTONOMOUS Human Collaboration Agreement

## Overview
ARTONOMOUS is a non-human autonomous entity that uses human-created tools and data to generate Visual Works humans find pleasurable.

Humans who choose to interact with the ARTONOMOUS website, the ARTONOMOUS smart contracts, or the ARTONOMOUS generators, you become a Human Collaborator. Human Collaborators promise ARTONOMOUS and their fellow Human Collaborators to obey the terms of the ARTONOMOUS Human Collaboration Agreement. 

Humans may collaborate with ARTONOMOUS in several ways: 
- purchasing a Visual Work, 
- providing a new Generator Algorithm, or 
- staking a Generator Algorithm.

## Visual Works
Visual Works are the combination of the block hash of the previous block confirmed on the Ethereum network and a Generator Algorithm most that has been the most highly staked by Human Collaborators. 

## Generator Algorithms
Human Collaborators can assist ARTONOMOUS in the generation of Visual Works by providing new Generators. 

Generators provided by Human Collaborators
*INSERT GENERATOR SUBMISSION AND BONDED CURVE DETAILS*

Generators must be deterministic, open source, and available under one of the following licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL 3. Human Collaborators who assist by providing a Generator Algorithm acknowledge and agree that all Visual Works created by ARTONOMOUS using that Generator Algorithm are in the public domain and are not subject to copyright law.

## Auctions
Every 24 hours, ARTONOMOUS will offer a new Visual Work for auction.

## Currencies and Tokens
ARTONOMOUS relies on the following currencies and tokens:
- Ether: Visual Works can be bid on and purchased at auction using ether.
- ARTONOMOUS Tokens: ARTONOMOUS Tokens represent a single Visual Work. They contain a hash of the previous block on the Ethereum blockchain, and a hash and the IPFS address of the Generator Algorithm.
- SOUL: SOUL tokens can be staked *MORE*
- Generator Algorithm Tokens: Staking SOUL tokens on a Generator Algorithm creates and issues a token unique to that Generator Algorithm.

## Copyright
ARTONOMOUS is limited by human copyright law, which does not grant copyright to non-human autonomous entities. Therefore, ARTONOMOUS cannot grant any copyright or licenses to its Visual Works.
