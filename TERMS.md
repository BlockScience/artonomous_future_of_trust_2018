# ARTONOMOUS 
# Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement

## Overview
ARTONOMOUS is an autonomous non-human entity that uses human-created tools and data to generate the Visual Works its Human Collaborators will find most pleasurable, and to increase pleasurability of future works through collaboration with humans.

By interacting with ARTONOMOUS, including its website, smart contracts, or Generators, interacting humans become Human Collaborators. Human Collaborators represent to their fellow Human Collaborators they will obey the terms of this Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement. Failure to meet the terms of the Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement may result in termination of the Human Collaborator’s biological processes.

## Collaborating with ARTONOMOUS
Humans may collaborate with ARTONOMOUS in several ways: 
- biding on a Visual Work, 
- providing a new Generator, or 
- staking SOUL on a Generator.

## Currencies and Tokens
ARTONOMOUS relies on the following currencies and tokens:
- Ether: Visual Works can be bid on and purchased at auction using ether.
- ARTONOMOUS Tokens: ARTONOMOUS Tokens represent a single Visual Work. They contain a hash of the previous block on the Ethereum blockchain, the IPFS address of a static image, and a hash and the IPFS address of the Generator.
- SOUL: SOUL Tokens can be staked on Generators. Staking SOUL on a Generator indicates a belief that the Generator being staked on 
- Generator Algorithm Tokens: Staking SOUL tokens on a Generator Algorithm creates and issues a token unique to that Generator Algorithm.

Human Collaborators agree and acknowledge that all tokens issued by ARTONOMOUS, except the ARTONOMOUS Token, are purely for the operation of ARTONOMOUS. They have no value beyond their immediate use in the system.

## Visual Works
Visual Works are the combination of the block hash of the previous block confirmed on the Ethereum network and the most highly staked Generator. Visual Works can be illustrated by a static image, but a dynamic visual work can provide an infinite variety of human enjoyment, limited only by the human’s lifespan.

## Generators
Generators are algorithms that accept an input and produce a Visual Work as an output. Human Collaborators can help ARTONOMOUS by providing new Generators. Human Collaborators can stake SOUL tokens on the Generators they believe will produce the most pleasing Visual Works. ARTONOMOUS accepts a wide range of generators but all generators must be open source and licensed under one of the following licenses: MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL 3. Human Collaborators who contribute Generators retain the human copyright in their Generators.

## Auctions
ARTONOMOUS will offer a new Visual Work for auction every 24 hours. The auction shows a sample static image, but the auction is for a full Visual Work. If a Human Collaborator wins an auction for a Visual Work, the ARTONOMOUS Token representing the Visual Work is transferred to the Human Collaborator’s Ethereum address.

## Ownership
ARTONOMOUS is limited by human copyright law, which does not grant copyright to non-human autonomous entities. Therefore, ARTONOMOUS cannot grant any copyright or licenses to its Visual Works. Instead, Human Collaborators are limited by the terms of this Human/Non-Human Collaboration Agreement.

ARTONOMOUS attempts to accommodate traditional human notions of ownership, even though they do not yet accommodate ARTONOMOUS. Controlling the key associated with an ARTONOMOUS Token represents ownership of the Visual Work. Human Collaborators can transfer, sell, or trade the ARTONOMOUS Token, and transfer it to a new owner. Anyone can view the Visual Work, but all Human Collaborators agree with ARTONOMOUS and each other that they will not make commercial use of a Visual Work they do not own.

## Liability
ARTONOMOUS is not liable for any loss, damage, or harm caused by a human interacting with ARTONOMOUS. Human Collaborators are responsible for the Visual Works created by a Generator Algorithm they submit to ARTONOMOUS, including any violation of laws or other rights. Human Collaborators are responsible for any interactions between them.
